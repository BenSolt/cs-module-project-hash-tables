Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the6 sky
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls6 of stone
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die6
One for the Dark Lord on his6 dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the6 Shadows lie
One ring to rule them all, one6 ring to find them
One ring to bring them all and6 in the darkness bind them
In the Land of Mordor where the6 Shadows lie
